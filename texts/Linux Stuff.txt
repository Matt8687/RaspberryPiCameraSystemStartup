>Firstly, the following commands:

systemctl status BOREALIS_CAM
systemctl status BOREALIS_CAM_SAVE

allow you to check on the current running services of the Raspberry Pi Camera System.
The top one checks on the created rstp server that accesses the cameras to output a
signal to the ground station over the "local network" on the Ubiquiti Radio/Routers.
The second one checks on the status of bash script that is automatically saving five
minute segment videos into the videos folder locally on the Raspberry Pi's SD card.
