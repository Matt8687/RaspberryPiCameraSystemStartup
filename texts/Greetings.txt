>Hello user, my name is Matthew Phillips and I am a student at Montana State University.
I will be the one guiding you through the process of understanding the Raspberry Pi 
Camera System that we developed at BOREALIS Labs. Please keep in mind that these are
purly automated messages and I am not directly messaging you.

>This program will run on startup everytime the Pi is booted unless you disable the
systemd service: systemctl disable BOREALIS_HELP. Though, it will hopefully provide some 
helpful insight into the system and make diagnostics slightly easier.

>To the left is a sidebar with several buttons that each hold useful information that
pertains to individual components of the payload, if you are not familiar with any of the
components in this payload I highly suggest reading through them, as they will provide an
overview to get you started.

>Thank you for choosing BOREALIS Labs when flyin-... erm... I-I mean, Thank you and good day.
